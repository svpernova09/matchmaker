# Matchmaker

----
## Introduction

Matchmaker is a dating application I am building using Laravel. It isn't intended for use at this time, it is basically just a project to help me better learn Laravel and TDD, or whatever else I'm working on.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands:

* `composer install`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* `cp .env.example .env`
* `php artisan key:generate`
* `php vendor/bin/homestead make`
* Edit `Homestead.yaml` as needed
* `vagrant up`
